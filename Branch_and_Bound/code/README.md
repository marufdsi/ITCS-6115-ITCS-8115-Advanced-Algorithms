Implement the Branch and Bound strategy to solve the problem you have been working on for the presentation.

You may want to consider multiple types of traversals, 
you may want to evaluate multiple branching strategies, multiple bounding strategies. You may want to consider parallel implementations, Depending on problem different considerations can make sense.

But this is an experimental process, multiple variants should be investigated.

Try to pick or find instances that will take time to solve (at least a few seconds).

If you have implemented the problem in a solver, which is faster?

Plot over time the number of states in consideration and the number that have been pruned as well as the value of the best known solution.
